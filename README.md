## âš Important: CORS Restriction

This project uses [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)'s live example to proxy demo API for demo-only propose.

In order to access API without CORS issue, please **[ Open This Page](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)** and **Click Button** for temporary accessing.

Or you can remove `CORS_PROXY` prefix in fetch path in `App.vue`. And install [CORS Unblock Chrome Extension ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) to get rid of CORS restriction.

> Be Careful. CORS Unblock should be used only in web development and trusted source. It could be dangerous or causing error in any websites.
